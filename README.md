# Machine Learning - Logistic_Regression

## Introduction
- This is a simple example of practicing the use of the Logistic Regression algorithm in Python

- `Assignment2_logistic.ipynb` includes Logistic Regression 

- `Assignment2.ipynb` includes KNN with VDM.

- The files `AssignmentKNN2_Logistic.pdf` contain the requirements for this practice.

- For more details about KNN, please visit [my GitHub](https://github.com/hungkaihsin/Machine-Learning_KNN) and [this page](https://hackmd.io/@hungkaihsin/ByiBK0Mtkg).

- For the Logistic Regression section, please visit [this page](https://hackmd.io/@hungkaihsin/rkUmkaun1l) for more details.

I extend my sincere gratitude to my mentors and the MS Data Science program for their continuous support and for cultivating an inspiring and collaborative learning environment in the field of machine learning.
